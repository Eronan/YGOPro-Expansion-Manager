## Features
* Move cards between expansions. (.cdb and .zip files)
* Create a new Card database to move into.
* Moves scripts and pictures from inside a zip file

## Useful For
* If you want to create and edit your expansions in the main YGOPro folder you can now quickly move cards from that expansion to another expansion for easy packing.

## How to use
In order to use the program simply open two databases. One is for saving to (on the left), and the other is for reading from (on the right).

### How it reads Pictures and Scripts
The program reads pictures and scripts from "pics" and "script" folders whether they be located inside a zip file of the same name as the database or directly placed in the same directory. So make sure that the files are placed inside those "pics" and "script" folders respectively whether those folders are inside a database or not.

If the file happens to be in both the zip file folder and directly in the directory folder. The program will take priority over the one in the directory folder. So make sure to remove the file from the folders temporarily if you don't want it to be saved.
